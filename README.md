petals_around_the_rose
======================

A very well known problem meant to decieve people with its defying, challenging logic, Finally a solution to it! The only thing that could solve this complexity was brainfuck! So posting the solution for general public...

Ways to run this,

1. Javascript Brainfuck compiler by Cal Henderson
**http://www.iamcal.com/misc/bf_debug
2. Install Brainfuck compiler/executor using brew, apt-get, whatever suits based on your environment.
- The code takes in 5 arguments and produces an output.
- You shouldn't enter any blank spaces, the values have to be between 1 and 6, (i.e. 12345 gives out 06 for instance.. and so on...)

***Have Fun!!
